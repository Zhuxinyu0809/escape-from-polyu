**1 Game Title**

 Escape from PoIyU

**2 Game Design**

**2.1 Game Concept**

 \"Escape from Polytechnic University\" is a looping puzzle VR game set on a Polytechnic University campus. The player takes on the role of a student who, due to heavy traffic before class, takes the elevator to the wrong floor. Opening the wrong door, they enter the \"looping corridor\" —a space that replicates elements of a real campus corridor (such as classroom signs and bulletin boards), but is empty.

Every time the player attempts to reach the exit at the end of the corridor, the space resets, returning them to their starting position. Only by correcting anomalies and solving puzzles based on clues can the player escape the corridor and return to the real campus.

The game recreates familiar campus scenes and uses a first-person VR perspective to heighten the tension of being trapped in an endless loop, creating an immersive gaming experience.

**2.2 Game Objective**

The core objective of the game is for the player to assume the role of a student trapped in a "looping corridor." By correcting anomalies and solving all puzzles, they overcome the spatial reset mechanism, ultimately escaping from the end of the corridor and returning to the real campus. In the empty corridor of the PolyU campus, by
 triggering the exit reset multiple times, the player will understand
 the rule that \"infinite loops occur if puzzles are not solved\".
 Then, according to system prompts, the player locates and fixes
 abnormalities, and gradually solves all puzzles. During the process,
 with the immersive experience of the VR first - person perspective and
 the support of sound effects, the player explores in a tense
 atmosphere until all puzzles are solved, the trigger condition for
 exit reset is eliminated, and the player escapes the corridor
 smoothly.

 In addition, the game also includes an extended experience direction,
 encouraging players to explore every corner of the corridor carefully
 and discover easter eggs beyond the main game plot, so as to enrich
 the perception of the scene. This objective direction does not affect
 the progress of the core puzzle - solving, but makes the overall
 experience more in line with the sense of exploring a real campus.

**2.3 Game Interaction Design**

 Based on the interactive characteristics of VR hardware devices, this
 game combines the head - mounted display (HMD) and controllers to
 achieve immersive operations:

1. Spatial Positioning and Perspective Control

   Based on the interactive features of VR hardware devices, this game
   integrates headsets and controllers to achieve an immersive
   operation experience. The built-in position tracking and orientation
   sensing of the VR headset can real-time determine the player\'s
   position and facing direction in the virtual corridor, and the
   player\'s perspective is completely controlled by head movements,
   enabling natural first-person observation and exploration. 

2. Controller and Button Interaction

   The controller simulates hand gestures: players can press buttons to trigger switches (e.g., triggering remote control buttons or turning on a switch), use rays to simulate opening doors, picking up items, and moving objects, and provide tactile feedback through vibration when the player triggers specific events (e.g., locking a door).

   **2.4 Game Scenes**

   **Core space:** The Loop Corridor, which is modeled with reference
   to the real buildings of the PolyU campus, including:

   **.** Classroom door plates (in the real numbering format)

   **.** Bulletin boards, desks, and corridor lights

   **.** Door (the end - point of the player\'s puzzle -
   solving)

   **Atmosphere creation:**

   **.** Sound: Repeating after - class bells, the sound of current in
   the lights, and echoes in the corridor.

   **.** Vision: The corridor lights flicker on and off, and the
   emergency exit resets and disappears repeatedly, creating a sense of
   disorientation.

   **.** Loop effect: Every time the player walks to the end of the
   corridor, they are \"pulled back\" to the starting position,
   enhancing the sense of being trapped.

**3** **Why** **This** **Game** **Will** **Be** **Fun** **to** **Play**
**in** **VR**

**3.1** **Immersive Experience**

 The game scene is highly reconstructed through 3D scanning of the
 PolyU campus corridor, including details such as lighting, door
 plates, and bulletin boards. In VR, players experience a strong sense
 of being in a familiar yet abnormal loop. Repeated attempts to reach
 the exit only to be reset create a striking contrast between
 familiarity and disorientation, enhancing immersion. Meanwhile, the
 echoing school bell and flickering lights further build a tense
 atmosphere, offering an experience that traditional screen-based games
 cannot achieve.

**3.2** **Realistic Operational Experience**

 In this VR game, the player\'s puzzle - solving process is no longer
 completed through mouse clicks or keyboard commands, but through
 natural body movements. For example, reaching out to push a door,
 picking up items, piecing together clues, or adjusting devices. This
 immersive operation method makes puzzle - solving more similar to
 real - life behaviors, thereby greatly enhancing the sense of
 participation and realism. The player is not only \"thinking about how
 to solve the puzzle\" but also \"completing the puzzle with their own
 hands\". Therefore, every process of fixing abnormalities and solving
 problems brings a more direct sense of accomplishment and engagement,
 an experience that traditional 2D games cannot match.

**3.3 Sense of Free Exploration**

 With the free perspective and immersive space design of VR, players
 can, in addition to exploring the main puzzle - solving line, notice
 detailed elements in the corridor, such as posters on the bulletin
 boards, messages on the walls, and even videos that can be played on
 the classroom screens. These hidden easter eggs provide players with
 additional motivation for exploration, making the game experience more
 in line with the process of exploring a real campus and also offering
 an opportunity to learn more about the school\'s history related to
 the theme of \"Escape from PolyU\". Although this content does not
 directly affect the progress of the core puzzle - solving, it enriches
 the player\'s perception of the scene, enhances the sense of
 engagement, and increases the fun of exploration, thus extending the
 immersive experience of the game.

**4 Feasibility of Game Development**

**Hardware Support**

 The game runs on mainstream VR HMDs (such as Meta Quest and HTC Vive).
 These devices all have position tracking, controller operation, and
 immersive display capabilities, which can fully support the
 interaction design of this project.

**Software and Development Tools**

 **.** Unity engine is used for development. This engine has good
 support for VR technology, with mature technology and convenience for
 collaboration.

 **.** Scene modeling and texturing can be completed using mature tools
 such as Blender and Maya. At the same time, 3D scanning technology can
 also be used for modeling large - scale scenes.

 . The game logic (such as loop reset and puzzle triggering) can be
 implemented through script programming. The technical difficulty is
 moderate, and the existing programming and modeling skills of the team
 can cover the requirements.

**5 Initial puzzle and anomaly design**

**5.1 Abnormal lighting**

• Trigger: Halfway down the hallway, the lights start flickering.
• Solution: Find the electrical box and flip the switch to restore power.

**5.2 Chair Abnormality**

• Trigger: Entering a classroom, I found that the chairs were all in the sky.
• Solution: Put the chair back on the ground.
